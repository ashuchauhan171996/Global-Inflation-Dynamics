# Global-Inflation-Dynamics

**Background:**
The choice to investigate global inflation and its relationships with variables such as GDP,
import-export rates, birth and death rates, and suicide rates stems from the topic's apparent
economic significance and practical implications. It felt appropriate to look back at historical
events and learn how inflation and numerous other factors were affected, especially considering
recent occurrences such as the Covid epidemic and International conflicts. With an emphasis on
the big picture, the project seeks to understand the complex relationships that exist between
economic variables and societal well-being in order to provide insights that may guide economic
and policy solutions. This decision is pertinent to the current state of the world economy and
timely.
