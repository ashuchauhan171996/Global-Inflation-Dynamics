# Global-Inflation-Dynamics

**Background:**

The choice to investigate global inflation and its relationships with variables such as GDP, import-export rates, birth and death rates, and suicide rates stems from the topic's apparent economic significance and practical implications. It felt appropriate to look back at historical events and learn how inflation and numerous other factors were affected, especially considering recent occurrences such as the Covid epidemic and International conflicts. With an emphasis on the big picture, the project seeks to understand the complex relationships that exist between economic variables and societal well-being in order to provide insights that may guide economic and policy solutions. This decision is pertinent to the current state of the world economy and timely.

**The visualization aims to help users:**
1. Understand Global Economic Dynamics: Recognize the complex relationships that exist between global inflation and important indicators.
2. Find Patterns: To create educated predictions, find trends in economic data.
3. Encourage Decision-Making: Offer perspectives to company executives and legislators to improve decision-making.
4. Educate: Serve as a readily available source of economics knowledge.
5. Encourage Comparative Analysis: Assist in examining economic information across nations, areas, or historical eras.
6. Emphasize the socioeconomic effects: Call attention to the economic and societal ramifications, as well as any relationships with metrics such as suicide rates.
7. Promote Informed Discourse on Global Economic Issues: Encourage Data-Driven Conversations.

The visualization project facilitates study of Global Inflation through the years and is a dynamic tool for correlating various other parameters that are linked to it. Users can investigate the complex linkages between inflation and important economic metrics like GDP, import-export rates, and societal issues like suicide rates through interactive visualizations and data representations. The visualization can find worldwide trends, patterns, and comparative assessments.

Our visualizations aim to show two main things: the relationship between inflation in differentcountries over the years, and how the inflation of a country relates to economic and social world development indicators. We see some factors to be independent of inflation as well, like GDP.
To facilitate user engagement, we added interactions to select countries and parameters for comparison wherever possible, and we have added features like zoom in and out, and zooming
on a particular section of graph.

Let’s take a look at all the different visualizations we have generated, what it shows and how we
can interact with it.

**1. Comparison of Inflation of countries over time:** 
This cartogram shows how the inflation rates have changed over many years, giving visitors a historical perspective on how inflation has affected various countries. The intensity of inflation is represented by a color gradient. Lighter colors denote high inflation, while darker shades denote low inflation. We use a slider to go through all the years starting from 1970 to 2022. This slider interaction makes it possible to visualize the data as an animation and see the changes using color gradients.

**2. Comparison of Inflation of countries over time:**
This multi-line graph shows the comparison of inflation of selected countries over time. For gaining maximum insights, we also represent the global average inflation of selected countries including all years. The representation is made interactive where we can select the countries for which we want to see and compare data. The xaxis shows the years and the y-axis represents inflation, with each line graph denoting one country.

**3. Variation in Inflation (1970 - 2022):**
Variation in data can be adequately represented using box plots, as in this visualization, which shows variations in inflation for selected countries. For each country, we can know the average inflation, maximum and minimum inflation rate touched, and any outliers if so. Here, each box plot will represent one country, and the y-axis represents inflation. We use interaction by creating a drop-list for selecting countries that we want to see in the visualization.

**4. Correlation of Inflation with other parameters with time:**
Inflation affects various economic parameters and aspects of an economy. Some of the main ones being GDP, Export of goods, Employment rate, Suicide rate, Foreign Investments, etc. Using a multi-line graph, we interactively show the correlation between inflation and any of these parameters for a selected country. As an example, we can set the parameter to Employment and the country as United states to see how Employment is varied with inflation over the years for this country.

**5. Correlation between selected parameters:**
To understand the global picture of how various parameters correlate to each other for a given year, we use scatter plot matrix. As in the example shown, we compare parameters like Employment, GDP and FDI but we make the plot interactive to vary the parameters we want to use for comparison.

The data used in this project is a global dataset that spans across multiple years in the past, and it relates to the happenings around the world in terms of economic and social events that have taken place. Here, to evaluate our work, we took help of these news to verify our results. Let’s look at some of these:

**1. Oil Crisis (1973-1974):** 
The OPEC oil embargo led to a spike in oil prices, causing a surge in inflation globally. We see most of the countries in yellow, especially the Americas and Africa.
This means high inflation throughout the world except parts of Asia like Russia which are rich in Oil themselves.

**2. Volcker Shock (1980-1981):** 
The U.S. Federal Reserve, led by Paul Volcker, raised interest rates sharply to combat inflation, contributing to a global recession. We can see a peak for all countries in the line graph below, suggesting surge in global inflation in 1980. The cartogram is also mostly yellow green for this year.

**3. Asian Financial Crisis (1997-1998):** 
Several Asian economies experienced severe economic downturns, affecting global inflation. We see from the cartogram below, that most of the Asian continent is yellow, suggesting high inflation in 1997. Similar results are observed for 1998 as well, indicating high inflation, as confirmed by the real facts.

**4. Global Financial Crisis (2007-2008):** 
The collapse of major financial institutions led to a worldwide economic downturn, prompting central banks to implement unconventional monetary policies.

**5. COVID-19 Pandemic (2020):** 
The global pandemic disrupted economies worldwide, leading to both supply and demand shocks, with varying effects on inflation. In the line graph below, we see a rise in inflation from 2020-2022, and the cause of this as we all know is the Covid Pandemic that struck us.

**6. Dissolution of the Soviet Union (1991):** 
The Soviet Union collapses, leading to the emergence of new independent states and significant geopolitical changes. The line graph clearly indicates a bad time for Russia in the 1990s following this crisis.

For this project, I used Python Flask for the backend and React JS for frontend development.

**Backend Framework: Python Flask**
Backend Libraries:
1. SQLAlchemy: Utilized for storing the inflation and world development indicator
database within the application.
2. Pandas: Employed for data manipulation by converting data into dataframes.
   
**Frontend Framework: React JS**
Frontend Libraries:
1. React-apexcharts: Used for rendering multiline graphs.
2. Plotly.express: Employed for generating choropleth maps.
3. React-select: Utilized for creating dropdown lists.
4. Bootstrap: Integrated for CSS styling.
5. Pandas.plotting: Applied for drawing scatter matrix plots.
