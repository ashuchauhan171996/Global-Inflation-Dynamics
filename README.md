# Global-Inflation-Dynamics

**Background:**

The choice to investigate global inflation and its relationships with variables such as GDP,
import-export rates, birth and death rates, and suicide rates stems from the topic's apparent
economic significance and practical implications. It felt appropriate to look back at historical
events and learn how inflation and numerous other factors were affected, especially considering
recent occurrences such as the Covid epidemic and International conflicts. With an emphasis on
the big picture, the project seeks to understand the complex relationships that exist between
economic variables and societal well-being in order to provide insights that may guide economic
and policy solutions. This decision is pertinent to the current state of the world economy and
timely.

**The visualization aims to help users:**
1. Understand Global Economic Dynamics: Recognize the complex relationships that exist between global inflation and important indicators.
2. Find Patterns: To create educated predictions, find trends in economic data.
3. Encourage Decision-Making: Offer perspectives to company executives and legislators to improve decision-making.
4. Educate: Serve as a readily available source of economics knowledge.
5. Encourage Comparative Analysis: Assist in examining economic information across nations, areas, or historical eras.
6. Emphasize the socioeconomic effects: Call attention to the economic and societal ramifications, as well as any relationships with metrics such as suicide rates.
7. Promote Informed Discourse on Global Economic Issues: Encourage Data-Driven Conversations.

The visualization project facilitates study of Global Inflation through the years and is a dynamic tool for correlating various other parameters that are linked to it. Users can investigate the complex linkages between inflation and important economic metrics like GDP, import-export rates, and societal issues like suicide rates through interactive visualizations and data representations. The visualization can find worldwide trends, patterns, and comparative assessments.

Our visualizations aim to show two main things: the relationship between inflation in differentcountries over the years, and how the inflation of a country relates to economic and social world development indicators. We see some factors to be independent of inflation as well, like GDP.
To facilitate user engagement, we added interactions to select countries and parameters for comparison wherever possible, and we have added features like zoom in and out, and zooming
on a particular section of graph.

Letâ€™s take a look at all the different visualizations we have generated, what it shows and how we
can interact with it.

**1. Comparison of Inflation of countries over time:** 
This cartogram shows how the inflation rates have changed over many years, giving visitors a historical perspective on how inflation has affected various countries. The intensity of inflation is represented by a color gradient. Lighter colors denote high inflation, while darker shades denote low inflation. We use a slider to go through all the years starting from 1970 to 2022. This slider interaction makes it possible to visualize the data as an animation and see the changes using color gradients.
